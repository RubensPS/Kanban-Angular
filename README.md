# Project Overview

This project is a simple kanban board, built with Angular 13. It's the product of the last task for Let's Code fullstack course.
Kanban is a known workflow management method, often related to Agile software development, but originated from manufactoring.
It consists of colored cards, each representing a task. The color indicates in what stage of the process the task is. Kanban is
a visual tool that helps improve efficiency. Despite the relation with Agile development, it can be used for any process, even
for simply organizing your own daily chores at home.

# Requirements

## API

The project must use JWT authetication, so before any request, the user must login to receive a token, in json, that will be sent in all
further requests.

- **GET**: obtains a list of cards. The API returns an array.
- **POST**: adds a new card. The API returns the card with a unique ID;
- **PUT**: put changes the data from an existing card. The user can change its title and content. The API returns the card with all changes;
- **DELETE**: removes an existing card. The API returns an array with the remaining ones.

The API has to be used for the cards persistence. The REST API works with data persistence in memory and can't be changed.

## Project

1. The graphical interface must have two screens. One for the login form and the other for the kanban board;
2. The kanban board must have three columns. Todo, Doing and Done, representing the task stages;
3. The login screen is accessed from the /login route and the kanban board, from the /kanban-board route;
4. The kanban board can only be accessed if theres a token in local storage;
5. The cards will be listed in each column using their list property;
6. A form to create a new card, with title and content, must be presented, with a button to add it;
7. A new card must always be created in the "ToDo" column;
8. All cards must have two versions. Visualization and edition;
9. In visualization mode, the card will have 4 buttons:
	- Two for changing status, one fowards and one backwards;
	- One for delete the card;
	- One to enter edit mode;
10. In edition mode, the card will have two fields. One for the title and other for the content, with two buttons:
	- One cancelling the changes;
	- One confirming the changes;
11. The finished project must be pushed to Github.

## Concepts worked in the project

- Components;
- Databiding;
- Directives;
- React forms;
- Routes;
- Services and dependency injection;
- Observables;
- HTTP requests;
- Authentication and route guard.

# How to start the program

## API launch

- Go to BACK folder;
- type "npm install";
- type "npm run server".

The API will be open at port 5000.

## Development server

- Run "ng serve" for a dev server;
- Navigate to "http://localhost:4200/".

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Credentials

The user will be able to login with the following credentials:
	- username: "letscode";
	- password: "lets@123".


# Final thoughts

This was a very rewardable project. It was a nice challenge to use all the concepts listed above in such a short time frame.
A special thanks to Larissa, our teacher, to be so patient and guide us through all the way, dealing with all our frustrations.
Also thanks to Let's Code and Santander to give us the oportunity to learn.
